Using instance segmentation, the model analyzed the input image and successfully detected two separate object instances: one keyboard and one mouse. Instead of only drawing bounding boxes, the model generated precise pixel-level masks for each object, allowing it to clearly outline their exact shapes. During prediction, the system first preprocessed the image, then performed inference to locate and segment each instance, and finally applied postprocessing to refine the masks and prepare the visual output. The final segmented image was saved in the output directory, where each object is highlighted with its own mask, demonstrating the model’s ability to distinguish and isolate individual objects in the scene.
